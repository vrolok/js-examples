# Categories

There are numerous ways we can categorize all of the design patterns but for the sake of brevity, the three most popular are: creational, structural & behavioral. _Creational_ focuses on object creation (imagine that). _Structural_ focuses on object composition. _Behavioral_ focuses on communication between objects.

## Creational Design Patterns

Deal directly with object initialization procedures focusing on the creation of situation-specific objects. Without thinking about how objects are created, a level of complexity can be added to the design of an application. Creational design patterns work to solve this problem by adding a layer to the object creation process.

## Structural Design Patterns

Are ones that focus on easing the relationship between different components of an application. They help to provide stability by ensuring that if one part of the app changes, the entire thing doesn't need to as well.

## Behavioral Design Patterns

Emphasize flexibility through the identification of common communication patterns between various objects.
